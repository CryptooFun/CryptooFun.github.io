<div style="text-align: justify"> Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are used as virtual currency and do not exist in any physical form. Unlike currencies in the classical sense, cryptocurrencies are not issued by a central authority. This feature is perhaps the most attractive aspect of cryptocurrencies for investors. 18,000 businesses around the world now accept various cryptocurrencies in transactions. Cryptocurrencies, which are both a payment tool and an investment tool, are reaching more and more users day by day. According to 2022 data, the entire market cap of crypto is $1.76 trillion, with daily crypto trading reaching $93.4 billion. Between 2012 and 2022, the price of Bitcoin increased by over 540,000. In addition to this, it already has 300+ million active users. There are respondents who stated that they own or use cryptocurrencies in 56 countries and regions around the world from 2019 to 2022. Considering that Turkey is in the 3rd place in this ranking, we can see that people who want to make money easily prefer this market. This market, which has reached large masses and has proven its existence, opens the door to wealth for many investors. People who have developed themselves in this field and who try to make a living by providing investment consultancy also benefit from the returns of this market. The main reason for the need for consultancy is to understand the risks and dynamics of this market and to prevent possible monetary losses. Through many sites and applications, people are trying to make a profit by buying and selling in this market. To understand and gain experience in this market, many investors damage their assets by making wrong investments.

<br />
The aim of our project is to ensure that people make minimal losses from their future investments by practicing with our application before investing their money in cryptocurrency exchanges. We will also provide real stock market experience by receiving the data of cryptocurrencies live. Thus, the experiences that people will have, will be more suitable for real life. In addition, there are a lot of cryptocurrency training videos on the market. Users will be able to reinforce their knowledge through our application by applying the investment techniques they learned after watching the tutorial videos. The feature that distinguishes our project from other projects in the market is that we will enable people to compete while improving their knowledge with practice. Thus, we will encourage people to use our app. We will reveal the competitive environment by making various leagues and publishing the overall balance in the statistics table. Users will be able to increase their balance with the gift starting balance we will give them when they sign up for the application, as well as their actual virtual balance with daily login rewards. At the same time, an extra reward balance will be given with the profits they get from the game lobbies they enter. Thus, we will show the 20 people with the most balances in the statistics table. In addition, people will be able to see how they rank in their profiles.
