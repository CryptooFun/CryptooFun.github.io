<div style="text-align: justify"> Cryptocurrencies, which have entered our lives rapidly in recent years, continue to be the investment tools that people invest the most. According to 2022 data, there are currently 300+ million users actively investing in cryptocurrencies.  The global crypto market cap is $1.06 trillion as of August 1, 2022. The reason for starting this business for the first time is usually to make money quickly in the easy way. The number of cryptocurrency exchanges and cryptocurrencies is increasing day by day. People are investing in cryptocurrencies, thinking that the market will make a lot of money, and at the same time, with the aim of making quick profits. However, people trying to get used to this market are unaware that the cryptocurrency market carries great risks. They can enter the money they have in these markets without any training.
<br />
<br />
Our aim in our project, which shows the risks of cryptocurrencies and how to invest, is to educate and entertain users who are considering entering the market, have little money or no money to invest. In short, we want to create an investment simulation. We want to produce an application that allows people to test themselves with their virtual balances in the real market by taking the data of cryptocurrencies live. By registering for this application, people will be able to invest in live cryptocurrencies with a certain amount of virtual balances given to them as a new registration gift. In this way, they will have a chance to experience the dynamics of this risky market. However, another feature we want to do is to create game lobbies within the application and enable people to enter these lobbies and compete for profit or balance among themselves. In this way, users will try to reach the target given to them and learn the dynamics of the market. At the same time, they will try to push themselves to a higher level by competing against different users. From the technical point of view, we are planning to design the application back-end based on micro-services architecture. We believe that these architectural decisions were made will be beneficial for better user experience by covering certain non-functional requirements such as scalability, redundancy, availability.
